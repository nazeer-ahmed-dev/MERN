/*
class 1 by me

    V8 ->
        Virtual Enivorment multiple script running Nodejs for Server
        side is using by v8

    Autentication and Authorization ->
        Authentication and authorization are used in security, particularly when it comes to getting access to a system. Yet, there is a significant distinction between gaining entry into a house (authentication) and what you can do while inside (authorization).
    
    JWT ->
        JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are an RFC 7519 open industry standard for representing claims between two parties. For example, you can use jwt.io to decode, verify, and produce JWT.
    
    Module in NodeJs
        -> BuiltIn
        -> Third Party Moduel
            Bye using npm and yarn we use those module like express
        -> Custom Module
            make your own
    Differnces
        -> child process
            Creating multiple thread simultaneously in node js we call it a child proces
            created using four way which is clubbed in async call like (spawn , fork , exec , execute and execfile)
            exec -> exectue any script like (echo , home , variable)
            execFile -> similar to exec but can not run wihtout termial or shell
            fork and spawn -> fork is special instance of spawn it uses a separate v8 engine so we know that node js run
                                on v8 engine so when we run fork or when we create a child process using fork it runs on separate v8 engine
                                but if we run .js using spawn it will be running on same v engine on which the main thread is running but it will run on differnt but on the same v88 engine unliess and until 
                                spawn(node server.js) : then it will create a differnt v8 engine else it will run on same engine
            spawn -> meant for huge amount of data so it returns a stream
            exec -> return a buffer 200k memoery
        
        -> Thread Pool
        -> Cluster

    app.use
        use is a way to register middleware or chain of middlewares (or multiple middlewares) before executing any end route logic or 
        intermediary route logic depending upon order of middleware registration sequence.
